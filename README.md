```

## How to work with the project

1. Open the Project in IntelliJ.
2. Navigate to the `theme.json` file and start the preview if you 
   want to fiddle around with my choice of colors.
   See also following [preview issue](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-208996)
   that might produce some problems with the included background
   image.
3. You might also want to have a look at the really helpful 
   [JetBrains Documentation for Custom UI Themes](http://www.jetbrains.org/intellij/sdk/docs/reference_guide/ui_themes/themes_intro.html)
